##### 1. What was the hardest part?

The hardest part was implementing the genetic algorithm for our bot. Although it is working, it sometimes takes more than what it should to guess the code.
Making one algorithm that would solve our game took most time of the project.
But also making AxiomMind a full multiplayer game was pretty challenging, and definitely the coolest part for me.

##### 2. If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

Plan harder in the beginning before start writing the code. Since we did not know how much time it would take us for build the project, we rushed in the back-end project.
And when we decided to implement the front-end and the bot, merging them to our existing code was not as good as we wanted.
Also the code would be better structured.

##### 3. If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be? 

I really liked this challenge. It was difficult, interesting, feasible and very well explained.
But I would merge challenge one into three, since everybody would have the same time to do the same challenge for back-end.
